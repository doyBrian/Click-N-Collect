# Click 'N Collect Game

## Overview

This is a memory game with React. 

### Design Notes

The design require to break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

### Instructions

1. The application will render different (pre-selected) images to the screen. Each image will listen for click events.

4. The application keeps track of the user's tally. The user's tally is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score will reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

5. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page will be shuffled in a random order.

6. Once the user guesses all successfully, the game will reset to 0.
